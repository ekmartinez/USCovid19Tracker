# USCovid19Tracker

This application will let you track, analyze and visualize Covid-19 data in your state.  To use it just download the historical data CSV file available at https://data.cdc.go, then follow the steps described to view the desired data or state.  There are still some issues to be tweaked, but as of today the app is ready to go.
